your entire crew. You are the last surviving member and your last
mission is to get the neutron destruct bomb form Weapons Armory,
put it in the bridge, and blow the ship up after getting into an
escape pod.

You're running down the central corridor to the Weapons Armory when
a Gothon jumps out, red scaly skin, dark grimy teeth, and evil clown costume
flowing around his hate filled body. He's blocking the door to the
Armory and about to pull a weapon to blast you.

The Gothon stops, tries not to laugh, then busts out laughing nad can't move.
While he's laughing you run up and laugh and shoot him square in the head
putting him down, then jump through the Weapon Armory door.

You do a dive roll into the Weapon Armory, crouch and scan the room
for more Gothons that might be hiding. It's dead quite, too quite.
You stand up and run to the far side of the room and find the
neutron bomb in its container. There's a keypad lock on the box
and you need the code to code to get the bomb out, If you get the code
wrong 10 times then the lock closes forever and you can't
get the bomb. The code is 4 digits.

take control of the shop. Each of them has an even uglier

and blast the lock so the Gothons can't get out.
Now that the bomb is placed you run to the escape pod to
get off this tin can.

You rush through the ship desperately trying to make it to
the escape pod before the whole ship explodes. It seems like
hardly any Gothons are on the ship , so your run is clear of
interference. You get to the chamber with the escepe pods, and
